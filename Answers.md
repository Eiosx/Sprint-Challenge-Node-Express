- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

Two parts of Express that stood out the most to me were routing and the easy set-up environment.

- [ ] Describe Middleware?

Middleware are basically functions that can increase the functionality of express. For example: captilazing user names stored on the request before being saved on the server or logging client requests being made to the server. 

- [ ] Describe a Resource?

A resource is just data that the server and client are manipulating. A specific resource can be big or small. Have other data depend on it or be relatively isolated. Examples include: users, posts, passwords, preferences, and etc.

- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

A response from the request handler. It can be in the form of a message or dynamic data. This information can also be used by front-end developers, who can then modify the presentation of the data. 

- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

This can be done through express routing and sectioning off files for each resource and its related endpoints.
